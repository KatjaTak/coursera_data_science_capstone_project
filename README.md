The commercial space age is here, companies are making space travel affordable for everyone. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches with a cost of $62 million. Other providers cost upward of $165 million for a launch.

Falcon 9 rocket has the payload enclosed in the fairings, the second stage that helps bring the payload to orbit, and the first stage that does most of the work and is quite large and expensive.

SpaceX can reuse the first stage boosters and achieve significant savings.

If we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.

In this project, we want to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. We train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.

This information can be used to predict the cost of a rocket launch in case an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX.

In this project, records of Falcon 9 rocket launches performed by SpaceX were collected and analyzed in order to predict the likelihood of a successful first stage rocket landing.

SpaceX API and web scraping were used for data collection, followed by data wrangling and exploratory data analysis. The most important variables were selected to train four different machine learning classification algorithms.

Optimal hyperparameters for logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, and k-nearest neighbors algorithms were identified and their prediction accuracy was compared to find the model performing the best.
